# System_Programming_Assingment_1
This is the first assginment of the course System Programming 2.
It contains a Graph class and an Algorithms class.
The Graph has an adjecency list for nodes and edges and operations which use it.
The Algorithms class has the 5 graph algorithms demanded (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Prim and Kruskal).
All data structures used can be found in the folder DataStructures.
The makefile has all the demanded commands (make main, test and valgrind).
The main itself is used for testing exceptions.
The test file (Testing) is used for tests of various functions, mainly in the Graph.

Important: There are issues that are unresolved in the project. These issues are mainly memory leaks and invalid reads. These issues are caused likely by deletion of a pointer too many times.
